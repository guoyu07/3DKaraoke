Magic
Moments
When two hearts are carin   Magic
Moments
Memories we've been sharin
I'll never forget the moment we kissed The night of the hayride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm While taking a sleigh ride
Magic
Moments
Memories we've been sharin
Magic
Moments
When two hearts are carin
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic
moments Filled with love! whistling
The telephone call that tied up the line For hours and hours The Saturday dance I got up the nerve To send you some flowers Magic
Moments
Memories we've been sharin
Magic
Moments
When two hearts are carin
Time can't erase
 the memory of These magic
moments
Filled with love
Whistling
The way that we cheered Whenever our team Was scoring a touchdown
The time that the floor fell out of my car when I put the clutch down!
The penny arcade The games that we played The fun and the prizes
The Halloween hop When everyone came In funny disguises
Magic
Moments
Filled with love
whistling
